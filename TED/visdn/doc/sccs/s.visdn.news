visdn provides a graphical user interface to a 7506 or 7507 ISDN phone on
a 730 terminal.  In addition to the normal 7506/7507 display, keypad,
and call appearance/feature buttons, you get the ability to

	- label, add, delete, change, or move buttons
	- add local buttons (audix password, calling card numbers, etc)
	- do directory queries using the keyboard (no more keypad!)
	- create heirarchical speed call lists on a button 2 menu
	- maintain call history in a file on the UNIX host
	- display post database information on incoming calls
	- display voice and audix help menus
	- receive electronic mail when you get audix messages or miss calls
	- probably other things, but I forget right now...

You customize the interface in your startup file, including button placement
and speedcall list initialization.  You press buttons with the mouse, select
numbers from the speedcall menu, and never have to touch the keypad again.

REQUIREMENTS:
	1. You need a 7506 or 7507 set on your desk.
	2. You must allocate a serial port on your 730 terminal to connect to
		the port on the back of the phone.
	3. You should have extra memory in the 730 terminal, 'cause this
		is a large application to download.
	4. Your 7506/7507 set must have ProPhone 1.5 firmware installed.

HOW TO GET PROPHONE 1.5 FIRMWARE:
	1. Do not ask the provider.
	2. Contact XXXXXXX (ihtelcom!xxxxxx)
