The following fixes and features were added to the latest "visdn"
program (which is NOT in exptools -- I never figured out how to get
it compiled and distributed everywhere).

=========================================================================
More ICI's now work:
	- "Pri" (priority)
	- "Pck" (call pickup)
	- "LIC" (Last In Call)
	- Hopefully all the others, too.

The letters a-z and A-Z are allowed in phone number in the following cases,
and are converted to the appropriate telephone digits (e.g., "a" is
converted to a "2"):
	- In speed call lists, when the 1st 2 characters of the value are "CA".
	  (It's possible to have a speed call entry that doesn't dial a number,
	   but instead sends a string to the phone to control it, e.g., "*B4"
	   to press button 4.  In this case, we wouldn't want the "*B4" to be
	   converted to "*24".)
	- When entering phone numbers (that begin with "CA") in the bottom of
	  the visdn window.
	- In Directory Query strings entered from the keyboard (this has always
	  been the case).
	- When entered via the UNIX command line using "cvisdn dial".
	  (More on the "cisdn" command below.)
This feature is useful to dial numbers like "1-800-CALLATT" without having
to figure out what the "CALLATT" maps to.

">" at the START of number now redials the previous number.
">" elswhere in a number still waits for secondary dialtone.

"+" as the first character of a phone number (e.g., "CA+92886") is not needed,
and in fact is ignored.  Otherwise, the "+" sends the string up to the "+" and
then waits for dialtone.

The new IH, IX, IW, and IHC Directory Query format (starting Sep 18, 1994)
now works.

The format of the log file changed:
	- All fields are now separated by tabs.
	  This makes it very easy to parse the records, but means that some
	  records are wider than an 80-column screen.
	- Added the call appearance field (e.g., "a=").
	- Added the Inid field (e.g., "InI", "OuI", etc.).
	- Added the duration of completed calls (in hh:mm:ss).
	- The called number, called name, calling number, and
	  calling name are saved in the log file.
	  If there is both an outgoing and incoming number (or name),
	  they are separated by a ":".
	  I considered using 4 separate fields (called number, called name,
	  calling number, calling name), but that would have made the log
	  records too long.

Logging works much much better.
	- All calls are logged.
	- Multiple simultaneous calls works now.
	- Don't get spurious "d"isconnect entries.

Fixed a bug where electronic mail wasn't always sent on "u"nanswered calls.

Entering a 'q' in a directory query now sends a '7' instead of a '9'.

Added some new command-line options (see the man page for more info):

	-E	Leaves the visdn window open after the last call is done.

	-F	Tracks the status of features, and optionally writes the
		status to a separate file (or a UNIX pipe).
		Also see the "-L" option on the man page.

	-O	Opens (i.e., uniconizes) the visdn window on OUTGOING calls.


Added the ability to send strings to the phone from the UNIX command line
using the "cisdn" command.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

pqinfo= added.	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

References to "cornet" were deleted since it's no longer used.

UTS processes no longer die when new calls come in.

Added debugging for the phone line -- visdn writes to the debug file
everything the phone sends to the 730.
This is mostly for my debugging use,
although I highly suggest you add "2> /tmp/$LOGNAME.visdn" to the command
line (or some other temporary file) to catch any error message and any
debugging output.
To get this debugging output, start visdn with "-D 64" or, once it's running,
toggle the button 3, "debug->R  Raw phone line" menu item.

You can now send debug output to a separate file using "-D filename" (as long as
"filename" doesn't begin with a [0-9]).
By default, any debugging you have turned on goes to stderr.
This is most useful for the tool supporter.

If visdn can't talk to the phone when it starts, it gives better error
messages and just sits there, rather than starting up anyway (and clearing
the error messages before you have a chance to see them).

The visdn version string now displays correctly at the top of the visdn window.

Added some new menu 3 items:
	cancel dial	to cancel an outstanding redial
	debug		submenu with debug options

===================== Known bugs ====================
ProPhone 1.6 doesn't work very well (the version number is displayed on the
terminal LCD when you start visdn).  This is a bug in the chip, not visdn.

The lights on the terminal for the speakerphone, mute button, and adjunct
speakerphone sometimes are incorrect.  This doesn't effect anything,
but it can be confusing.

Incoming CFA calls can give an "u"nanswered log entry even though you
answered the call.  This appears to be a ProPhone bug.
Luckily, you'll rarely receive an incoming CFA call (someone would have to
call another person who has their phone calls forwarded to you -- most people
have their calls forwared to Audix).

The 730 sometimes crashes (e.g., SYSTEM EXCEPTION) when exiting visdn if,
for example, you're running an older version of visdn, exit visdn,
then redownload a newer version of visdn.
It seems to help if you exit visdn the 1st time,
then exit layers, then get back into layers, and redownload visdn.
It's seems like exiting visdn doesn't always clear out all its memory,
and then downloading a new version get some of the old memory.

If you have an adjunct speaker phone and use "cisdn cfa some_number",
when it's done setting the Call Forward All number, you regular speaker phone
will turn ON.  Until I fix this, you'll have to turn it off by yourself.

Turning on some levels of debugging via the command line can cause
visdn (and possibly your layers session) to hang.
I've seen it happen when -D128 (SPEEDCALL) is used over TCP when the
speedcall list has lots of entries.
This shouldn't matter to most users, since normally you'll only use
debugging to help determine the cause of a problem.

When using the "info" window and you don't answer an
InX (incoming external) call that has a phone number, your info window
sometimes is cleared.  This doesn't happen with InI calls or calls you answer.
The missed InX call is still added to your "Missed Calls" speedcall list and
is still logged, though.

===================== Possible Future Enhancements ====================
